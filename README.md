# GenAI-Journey
This repository records my journey of transitioning from a backend engineer to an AI engineer focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

The learning process is divided into four major parts:

## 1. Deep Learning Foundations

Build solid understanding of basic neural networks (MLP, CNN, RNN) and master PyTorch for model development.

## 2. Transformer and Large Models

Deep dive into the architecture of Transformer, attention mechanisms, and foundational models like BERT and GPT.

## 3. Engineering Practice

Hands-on practice including model fine-tuning, parameter-efficient training (LoRA, QLoRA), building RAG systems, and model inference optimization.

## 4. Generative AI Applications

Explore prompt engineering, multi-agent systems, retrieval-augmented generation, and practical system design for GenAI applications.
